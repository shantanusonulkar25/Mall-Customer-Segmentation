The project aimed at identifying patterns in customer spending scores and demographics at a shopping mall, utilizing K Means Clustering to analyze and segment customer data effectively. To operationalize these insights and make them accessible, we developed a REST API, ensuring seamless integration between the machine learning model and a website. This API supports various functionalities, including retrieval of customer data and delivering clustering results, thus enhancing user interaction and analytical capabilities. Through meticulous integration of the frontend, backend, and API, coupled with thorough testing via a demo HTML form and Postman, the project delivers a cohesive and efficient solution for leveraging customer data to drive strategic decisions at the shopping mall.
